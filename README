Currently the fedora-generic role builds a single VM
The fedora-generic var use_dhcp determines whether you get a static ip address or a DHCP aquired one.

Once you're happy and you want to build a VM:

ansible-playbook playbooks/main.yaml

Once built, you can `ssh root@<ipaddr>` as your ssh key has been injected
